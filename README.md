Portable Multifunctional Air Purifier
The air purifier cleans the air using filters. There are two filters and steps of filtration. The first one is attached to the end of the air tube, it is a filter of zero resistance because it does not stop airflow but clean it and helps to remove bad smells and heavy gases. Filter of zero resistance can be easily removed and put again. If it is dirty you can take off it and put another one.

Second one is the tissue filter. The main function of it is purifying air from dust. Humidifier will let the dust settle on a tissue. It will squirt every 30 seconds with small trickle to keep the normal level of humidity in room based on humidity sensors.

Another function is demonstrating air content. Thanks to Arduino gas sensors (DHT11 and MQ-sensors) every user can see how much CO2 or CO and CH4 air contains.  These are dangerous gases for humans and this function would be useful for rooms with many people. If there are much gas, red diode will light up. If everything is okay, there will be green light. All information will be shown on display.
